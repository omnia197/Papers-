# Activation Functions in Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Survey and Benchmark

## What This Paper Is About

As I am learning deep learning and found that it is very important in solving problems like recognizing images, understanding language, and predicting patterns. One of the most important pieces of deep learning models is something called activation functions. Without them, deep learning would not work the way it does

This paper, written by *Shiv Ram Dubey*, *Satish Kumar Singh*, and *Bidyut Baran Chaudhuri*, gives a deep look at activation functions. It explains how they work, the different types that exist(There are ~40 or more acivation function which feels like Ahhhh!!), their strengths and weaknesses, and which ones work best in different situations. It also includes many experiments that compare these functions on tasks like image classification, language translation, and speech recognition

## Why Activation Functions Are So Important

Imagine a neural network like a machine made up of many tiny neurone that make all decision we need. These neurons take input -> do some math -> and then pass the result to the next layer. But if all the neurons just did simple math without any curve or twist, the whole network would be just a big calculator. It wouldn’t be able to learn anything useful.

Activation functions add that twist. They help the network:
- Understand complicated patterns (like a cat vs. a dog)
- Avoid getting stuck during learning
- Keep things running smoothly by controlling the output values

Without activation functions, no matter how many layers your neural network has, it would act like just one layer and that is not very smart!

## What Are the Types of Activation Functions?

The paper groups activation functions into several types. Each group has its own history, strengths, and reasons to use.

---

### 1- Sigmoid and Tanh Functions (The classic Ones)

These were the first functions used in neural networks. Sigmoid that squashes values between 0 and 1. and Tanh that squashes values between -1 and 1.

They are smooth and simple, but they have a big problem: when the input is very big or small, their output stops changing. This makes it hard for the network to learn, especially in deep models. But these functions still are sometimes used in simpler models or in natural language processing tasks.

### 2- ReLU and Its Family (Most popular deep learning Activation functions)

ReLU stands for Rectified Linear Unit. It's very simple: if the number is negative: it returns 0, if it’s positive: it returns the number (*RELU(x) = x if x > 0*)

It’s fast to compute, helps networks learn faster and fortunately it works well!! but has problems too. It doesn’t use negative numbers at all, which can cause some neurons to "die" and stop learning. That is why many new versions were created then.

### 3- ELU and Exponential Functions (smooth and strong)

ELU(Exponential Linear Unit) and its friends like SELU, CELU, and PDELU try to fix ReLU’s negatives by using exponential curves for negative numbers.

These are smoother and let some negative values pass through and some of them even self-normalize, keeping the data centered and scaled. It helps in:
- Keeping the output stable
- Improving training speed
- Reducing dead neurons

---

### 4- Adaptive Functions (The smart ones)

I could say that they are the next generation of activation functions. Instead of using a fixed curve, these functions learn their shape from the data like Swish, APL, MeLU, SLAF and other ones..

These are great if your data is complex or when different parts of the network might need different activation shapes.

## Final Thoughts 

The paper ran lots of tests on popular datasets like CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Spech Regognition and tested 18 activation functions on models like VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, and DenseNet. Now the authors the overall result that says *there’s no single best activation function* for every task. Instead, the right one depends on: Data type, model type, goal

A quick guide:

| Use Case                  | Recommended Activations     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Image Classification      | ReLU, ELU, Mish             |
| NLP / Transformers        | GELU, Swish, SLAF           |
| Deep Stable Training      | SELU, CELU, PELU            |
| Object Detection          | Mish, PAU                   |
| Simple or Fast Models     | ReLU, Leaky ReLU            |
| Learning from Complex Data| Adaptive (Swish, APL)       |

Advantages and disadvantages

| Activation Group                 | Best For                                                              | Watch Out For / Not Ideal For                                           |

| ReLU & ReLU Variants            | Image classification (e.g., CIFAR, ImageNet), CNNs, fast training     | Dead neurons (outputs stuck at 0), doesn't use negative inputs         |
| ELU & Exponential Variants      | Deep networks needing stability and fast learning                     | Slightly more complex, not ideal for very simple or real-time models   |
| Adaptive / Learning-Based       | Transformers, NLP models, dynamic data patterns, complex deep networks| Increased parameter count, slower training time                        |
| Miscellaneous (Mish, GELU, etc.)| Object detection, signal processing, custom applications              | May increase computational load, not always necessary for basic tasks  |
